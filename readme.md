# Impact of Labour Laws on Firm Productivity in India

The project seeks to explore how specific pro-labor laws, specifically section VB of the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA), influence firm behaviour. Utilising a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), this quasi-experimental approach aims to isolate the causal effects of these regulations on firm productivity, output, wages, expenses, profits and many more variables. The primary motivation behind this research stems from the paradox that pro-labor laws, while designed to benefit workers, may inadvertently hamper firm productivity, flexibility, diversity and work environments particularly in firms with over 100 employees due to stringent hiring and firing regulations.

The research is closely aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8 and 9, focusing on promoting sustained economic growth and fostering innovation through fair and effective labour laws. The study extensively reviews existing literature and incorporates data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) and Prowess-dx by CMIE to analyse firm-specific trends within the manufacturing sector.

Key findings indicate that the application of labour laws to firms with more than 100 employees does not significantly affect productivity, rather, the firms are strategically manoeuvring to mitigate the impact of these laws for instance hiring more contractual and female labour as these strategies offset the increased cost of hiring while maintaining the same level of productivity.
